## HelloWorld

```java
public interface Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b);
}

static class CalculatorImpl implements Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

static ContractId<Calculator> CALCULATOR = ContractId.create(Calculator.class, 0, METHOD_MAPPER_FACTORY);

static Server SERVER = new Server(
    CALCULATOR.service(new CalculatorImpl())
);

// start server
new SimpleSocketTransport(EXECUTOR, SERIALIZER, SERVER).start(EXECUTOR, new SimpleSocketBinder(ADDRESS));

// use client
Client client = SimpleSocketTransport.client(SERIALIZER, new SimpleSocketConnector(ADDRESS));
Calculator calculator = client.proxy(CALCULATOR);
System.out.println("2 + 3 = " + calculator.add(2, 3));
```
