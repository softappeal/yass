## HelloWorld

```kotlin
interface Calculator {
    suspend fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int
}

class CalculatorImpl : Calculator {
    override suspend fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
}

suspend fun useCalculator(calculator: Calculator) {
    println("2 + 3 = " + calculator.add(2, 3))
}

val CalculatorId = contractId<Calculator>(0, SimpleMethodMapperFactory)

val Server = SServer(
    SService(CalculatorId, CalculatorImpl())
)

val ContractSerializer = sSimpleFastSerializer(listOf(SIntSerializer), listOf())

val MessageSerializer = sMessageSerializer(ContractSerializer)

fun main() {
    val tcp = aSocket(ActorSelectorManager(Dispatchers.IO)).tcp()
    val address = InetSocketAddress("localhost", 28947)
    runBlocking {
        val serverJob = sStartSocketServer(GlobalScope, tcp.bind(address), SServerSetup(Server, MessageSerializer))
        val client = sSocketClient(SClientSetup(MessageSerializer)) { tcp.connect(address) }
        useCalculator(client.proxy(CalculatorId))
        serverJob.cancel()
    }
}
```
